## 0.1.9 | 3 May 2026

## 0.1.8 | 27 April 2026

- Incense burners now burn forever and auto-light on placement, just like candelabras
- Added a separate keybind for extinguishing the nearest lit incense and recovering the unused incense. Unbound by default.

- Settings menu reorganised. Existing values preserved.
- Existing settings are migrated automatically - your keybinds, distance, and column toggle are preserved
- Translations are now loaded from JSON files in the mod's `lang/` folder, so they're easier to fix up or contribute to
- Improved diagnostic logging for bug reports
- A one-time reminder now pops up in-game when Debug Logging is left on, so it doesn't stay on forever by accident
